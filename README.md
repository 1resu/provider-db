# Delta Chat Provider Info


## Add an Entry
First check wether the file for the provider already exists, if it does skip to the **Edit an Entry** section.

Add [provider name].md to the _providers folder in the following format:
~~~
---
name: [provider name]
domains: [ email domains of the provider / can also be yaml array when there are multiple ones can contain (â‚¬) to mark a premium domain]
credentials: [emailPass | emailAppPass | Oauth] - can also be an array, if multiple are supported availible
status:
   state: [OK | PREP | BROKEN] - "PREP" stands for Preparation Steps needed
   date: [YYYY-MM]
---
## Comments
[If there are any, but make sure everything regarding preparation is under "## Preparations"]

## Preparations

### Advanced Login Settings [if applicable]
```
[imap and smpt server addresses]
```

[if the provider requires additional steps, describe them here, you may also include images or a video tutorial of the process here]

## status history
[if you change the status, copy the previous here that we can allow for a history]
[has a table format? that we can color code the states]
[just a link to github changelog/history of this file?]
~~~

### Status options:

State | Meaning
---|---
OK | works right out of the box, no additional steps needed (exception to this are custom domain email addresses where you might need to specify the smtp and imap server manualy)
PREP | preparation step/s is/are needed - (a few steps are required then it works - for example enabling imap/smtp on provider page)
BROKEN | not working - Does not work. (too unstable to use falls also in this category)
