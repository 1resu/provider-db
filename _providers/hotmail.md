  Outlook email addresses will not work as expected as these servers remove some important transport information.
  Hopefully sooner or later there will be a fix, for now we suggest to use another email address.

Unfortunately outlook.com breaks using Delta Chat by manipulating messages in a way that we can't work around. We're very sorry indeed, but it's not our fault.

If this situation ever changes we will update this page, but for now please use a different email provider with Delta Chat.
